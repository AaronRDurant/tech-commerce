Yet to work with Stripe or build an e-commerce website, I set off in May 2022 to make something quick and straightforward that would afford me some initial experience with these tools and concepts.

Implementing Stripe was a joy, and I hope to use it for future projects. I'm also delighted to have a project utilizing a content management system like Sanity.io after years and years of using WordPress. Similarly, this was my first time using Next.js, which expanded my toolbox more!

## To Do ✅

I accomplished the goal of creating a simple e-commerce website. Still, I could always change up the content in Sanity.io and build the site out to have more pages and more of a purpose beyond simply demonstrating e-commerce functionality.
